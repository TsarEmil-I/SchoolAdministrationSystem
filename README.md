# SchoolAdministrationSystem
This project is a School Administration System designed to help streamline the administrative tasks of schools, such as managing student records, attendance, and other important functions. The system is built using ASP.NET Core with C#, and it utilizes HTML and CSS with the Tailwind CSS framework for the frontend. The purpose of this system is to provide an efficient platform for school administrators, teachers, and students to coordinate their academic and administrative responsibilities.

## 1. Attendance Tracking

+ Allow students to submit requests for absences due to personal reasons (e.g., sick leave, family matters).
+ Automated approval workflows for absence requests that notify the relevant teachers and staff.
+ Generate attendance reports for both students and administrators to monitor attendance trends over time.
  
## 2. User Roles and Permissions
+ Role-based access control for administrators and teachers.
+ Administrators have full control over managing users, configuring the system, importing CSV information and accessing reports.
+ Teachers can manage and track their students' attendance.
+ Students can access their own information and their parents are able to submit requests for absence.

### Technologies Used
+ Backend: ASP.NET Core (C#), JavaScript
+ Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS
+ Database: Microsoft SQL Server (a subject to change)
+ Authentication: ASP.NET Identity
